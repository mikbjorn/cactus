# Cactus Identification 

## Background
This projected focused on the identification of barrel cactus in 32x32 pixel images. The data set is from a kaggle competition (López-Jiménez et al 2019). The ability to identify barrel cactus remotely through aerial images would greatly improve the ability to track changes over vast landscapes. This study explores the use to Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, XGBoost classifiers, and Convolutional Neural Networks, as well as a weighted average of all models to predict the presence of cactus.
